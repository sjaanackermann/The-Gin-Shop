# The-Gin-Shop
Second attempt at Online Store Project

A PHP Online Shop web application.

## Getting Started

Download the project files from github onto your local machine.

### Prerequisites

```
You can use any of the follwoing free programs to set up a local host:
Xampp
Wamp
Mamp
```

1. To set this web application, make sure PHP and PHPMyAdmin is installed on your server.
2. Next open PHPMyAdmin, create a database and import the gin.sql file. This will generate tables in your database on your server.
3. Upload all files on your server except for gin.sql! 
4. The admin user which I have made has an email id: admin@admin.com and the password is password. (Please confirm this in db or create one manually.
5. Open config.php file and add the details of your PHPMyAdmin's id and password to access the database. Now re-upload this file to the server.
6. Once this is done, go to the url of your website and it should be up and running.

Enjoy!
